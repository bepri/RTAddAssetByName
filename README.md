# RTAddAssetByName
*An extension for Request Tracker written by Ben Sergent V and Imani Pelton*

This extensions modifies Request Tracker's 'Add Asset' section on tickets to allow adding assets by name instead of id. This saves users from opening a new tab to search for an asset to get its id everytime a new asset needs to be referenced by a ticket.
